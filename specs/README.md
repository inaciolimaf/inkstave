# Inkstave — Specification Roadmap

This folder is the **source of truth** for what to build and in what order.
Implement specs **strictly in numerical order**: finish `01` (code + passing
tests) before starting `02`, and so on. Each later spec assumes every earlier
spec exists and works.

## How each spec folder is structured

```
specs/NN-slug/
├── README.md     # the PROMPT for the implementing agent: goal, dependencies,
│                 # Overleaf references to study, and "requirements are in spec.md"
└── spec.md       # the detailed requirements: scope, data model, API/UI
                  # contracts, acceptance criteria, and the test plan
```

See [`_TEMPLATE/`](_TEMPLATE/) for the canonical structure all specs follow.

## Rules that apply to every spec

- **No Overleaf code is ever copied.** Overleaf (AGPLv3) is read only to
  understand approaches; Inkstave (MIT) is written independently. See `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Full test suite stays under 2 minutes.** Slow work → async ARQ jobs, mocked
  in tests.
- **A spec is done** only when its Definition of Done and Acceptance criteria
  pass, tests included.

## Refactoring cadence

Every 5th spec (**05, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60**) is a
**refactoring spec**: no new features. Agents scan everything built so far for
bugs and bad practices, judge whether each fix is worth applying, and apply the
worthwhile ones while keeping tests green.

### Phase 8 — Runtime & validated fix-packs
Specs 61–90 (`runtime-*` and `fixpack-*`) extend the roadmap with runtime-error
surfaces and a series of disjoint, parallel-applicable fix-packs closing
two-reviewer-validated issues across specs 01–59. See each folder's `README.md`.

### Phase 9 — Code-smell audit fix-packs
Each closes one cluster of findings from a 15-dimension code-smell audit
(magic numbers, missing logging, blocking the event loop, DRY, etc.). Unlike the
68–90 packs these are **sequential**, not disjoint: where two packs touch the
same file the later one declares a prerequisite on the earlier (e.g. 93 after 92,
94 after 92/93, 96 after 94, 99 after 95).

| # | Spec | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 91 | `91-fixpack-secret-hygiene` — rotate exposed key, pre-commit secret/`.env` guard | 🔧 |
| 92 | `92-fixpack-auth-logging` — log auth security events; stop swallowing WS-auth errors | 🔧 |
| 93 | `93-fixpack-async-offload` — Argon2/SHA-256/file-I/O off the event loop via `to_thread` | 🔧 |
| 94 | `94-fixpack-clock-injection` — injectable `Clock` for testable token/expiry logic | 🔧 |
| 95 | `95-fixpack-tree-entity-dry` — one shared TreeEntity-fetch helper; drop dead re-export | 🔧 |
| 96 | `96-fixpack-keyword-only-signatures` — keyword-only params; split control-couple flag | 🔧 |
| 97 | `97-fixpack-magic-numbers` — name budget TTL & section-locate score constants | 🔧 |
| 98 | `98-fixpack-pydantic-defaults` — `Field(default_factory=...)` for mutable settings defaults | 🔧 |
| 99 | `99-fixpack-query-efficiency` — kill a file-read N+1; bound unbounded tree fetches | 🔧 |
| 100 | `100-fixpack-schema-validation` — fail-fast `Field`/`Literal` constraints on two schemas | 🔧 |

### Phase 10 — Portability & email (new features)
Standalone feature specs added after the audit/fix-packs. Independent of the
fix-packs; implement after the core system is green.

| # | Spec | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 101 | `101-project-zip-import` — upload a `.zip` from another platform → reconstruct a brand-new project (async, zip-slip/zip-bomb safe) | 🟢 |
| 102 | `102-project-zip-export` — download the whole project as a streamed `.zip` (member-only, deterministic) | 🟢 |
| 103 | `103-email-delivery` — Mailpit dev inbox + Resend production sender; wire all transactional emails | 🟢 |
| 104 | `104-email-auth-flows` — link-based email verification, passwordless magic-link login, and password reset (shared single-use token store) | 🟢 |

**Core roadmap: 60 specs (48 feature 🟢 + 12 refactor 🔧), extended by fix-packs 61–100 and feature specs 101–104.**

> The roadmap can be extended later (the user may add requirements). New specs
> continue the numbering and keep the every-5th refactor cadence.
